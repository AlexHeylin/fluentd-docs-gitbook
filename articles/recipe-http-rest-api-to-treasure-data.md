# Getting Data From Http Rest Api Into Treasure Data Using Fluentd

Looking to get data out of http rest api into treasure data? You can do
that with [fluentd](//fluentd.org) in **10 minutes**!

Here is how:

``` {.CodeRay}
$ gem install fluentd
$ gem install fluent-plugin-td
$ touch fluentd.conf
```

`fluentd.conf` should look like this (just copy and paste this into
fluentd.conf):

``` {.CodeRay}
<source>
  @type http
  port 8888
  bind 0.0.0.0
  body_size_limit 32m
  keepalive_timeout 10s
  # tag is part of the URL, e.g.,
  # curl -X POST -d 'json={"action":"login","user":2}' http://localhost:8888/tag.here
</source>

<match **>
  @type tdlog
  apikey <Treasure Data API key> # You get your API key by signing up for Treasure Data
  auto_create_table
  buffer_type file
  buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
</match>
```

After that, you can start fluentd and everything should work:

``` {.CodeRay}
$ fluentd -c fluentd.conf
```

Of course, this is just a quick example. If you are thinking of running
fluentd in production, consider using [td-agent](/articles/td-agent.md), the
enterprise version of Fluentd packaged and maintained by [Treasure Data,
Inc.](https://www.treasure-data.com).
