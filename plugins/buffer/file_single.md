# file_single Buffer Plugin

The `file_single` buffer plugin provides a persistent buffer implementation. It
uses files to store buffer chunks on disk.

`file_single` is similar to `file_file` but this plugin doesn't have metadata file.


## Example Configuration

```
<match pattern>
  @type forward
  # forward parameters
  <buffer>
    @type file_single
    path /var/log/fluent/out_fwd
  </buffer>
</match>
```


## Parameters

-   [Common Parameters](/configuration/plugin-common-parameters.md)
-   [Buffer section configurations](/configuration/buffer-section.md)


### path

| type   | required | default | version |
|:-------|:--------:|:--------|:--------|
| string |     âœ”    |         |   1.7.0 |

The directory path where buffer chunks are stored. This parameter is required.

This parameter must be unique to avoid race condition problem between output plugins.
Of course, this parameter must also be unique between fluentd instances.

The actual path consists of 5 parts:

- `path` parameter
- `fsb` prefix
- tag or field value
- chunk id
- `buf` extension

```
# Example with <buffer tag> and tag is test.log
/path/to/buffer/fsb.test.log.b513b61c9791029c2513b61c9791029c2.buf
# Example with <buffer key> and record is {"key":"hello"}
/path/to/buffer/fsb.hello.b513b61c9791029c2513b61c9791029c2.buf
```

Under multi worker environment, worker_id and plugin id are added.

```
/path/to/buffer/worker1/out_fwd/fsb.test.log.b513b61c9791029c2513b61c9791029c2.buf
```

Please make sure that you have **enough space in the path directory**.
Running out of disk space is a problem frequently reported by users.


### calc_num_records

| type   | required | default | version |
|:-------|:--------:|:--------|:--------|
| bool   |          |   true  |   1.7.0 |

Calculate the number of records, chunk size, during chunk resume.

`buf_file_single` doesn't have metadata file, so
this plugin can't keep the chunk size accross fluentd restart.
If `true`, calculate the chunk size by reading file at start phase.

If your plugin don't need the chunk size,
you can set `false` to speed-up fluentd start time.

This option is mainly for `out_forward`.


### chunk\_format

| type | default | available values  | version |
|:-----|:--------|:------------------|:--------|
| enum | auto    | msgpack/text/auto | 1.7.0   |

Specify chunk content for `calc_num_records`.

With `auto`, the plugin decide chunk format by `formatted_to_msgpack_binary?`. This option is useful when the output plugin doesn't implement `formatted_to_msgpack_binary?` correctly.


## Limitation

### chunk keys

`buf_file_single` doesn't have metadata file, so `buf_file_single` can't use rich metadata.
chunk keys must be only tag or one field key for now.

```
<buffer>           # OK. Same as <buffer tag>
<buffer tag>       # OK
<buffer key>       # OK
<buffer time>      # NG. time is not supported
<buffer key1,key2> # NG. multiple field keys are not supported
```

This limitation will be removed by adding metadata header in the file.

### Remote file system is not supported

Caution, `file_single` buffer implementation depends on the characteristics of
local file system. Don't use `file_single` buffer on remote file system, e.g.
NFS, GlusterFS, HDFS and etc. We observed major data loss by using
remote file system.
